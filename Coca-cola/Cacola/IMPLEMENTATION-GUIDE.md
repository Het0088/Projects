# Futuristic Coca-Cola Website Implementation Guide

This guide provides instructions for implementing and customizing the futuristic Coca-Cola website.

## 1. Image Creation

### Option A: AI Image Generation
Use AI image generation tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion to create the required images:

For the **future-bottle.png**:
- Prompt: "Futuristic Coca-Cola bottle with glowing blue liquid, holographic elements, transparent glass, floating in dark space with blue particle effects, product photography, ultra-realistic, studio lighting"

For the **product images**:
- Quantum Cola: "Futuristic Coca-Cola bottle with glowing blue liquid and quantum particle effects surrounding it, sleek modern design, product photography on black background"
- Zero Gravity: "Futuristic Zero Sugar Coca-Cola with anti-gravity bubbles floating outside the bottle, blue and white color scheme, product photography"
- Bio Energy: "Bioluminescent green Coca-Cola variant in a futuristic bottle with energy waves emanating from it, product photography"
- Nebula Fusion: "Multi-colored nebula-themed Coca-Cola bottle with swirling galaxy patterns inside the liquid, cosmic design, product photography"

For the **logo**:
- "Futuristic Coca-Cola logo reimagined with glowing blue neon effect, minimalist design, transparent background"

### Option B: Photo Editing

1. Find stock images of Coca-Cola bottles (or photograph them yourself)
2. Use Photoshop or similar software to:
   - Adjust colors to match the blue/purple theme
   - Add glow effects with Outer Glow layer style
   - Create particle effects using brush tools
   - Add holographic elements and reflections

## 2. Website Setup

1. Create the necessary folders:
   - `/css`
   - `/js`
   - `/images`

2. Place all image files in the `/images` folder
3. Ensure all HTML, CSS, and JS files are in their respective locations
4. Test the website locally by opening `index.html` in a browser

## 3. Customization Options

### Colors
You can customize the color scheme by editing these variables in `css/style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #00b8ff;  /* Main blue color */
  --secondary-color: #121212;  /* Dark background */
  --accent-color: #ff006c;  /* Pink accent */
  --accent-secondary: #7000ff;  /* Purple accent */
}
```

### Animations
Adjust animation speeds and effects in the CSS file:

```css
.floating {
  animation: float 4s ease-in-out infinite; /* Change 4s to faster/slower */
}
```

### Text Content
Modify the marketing copy in `index.html` to fit your specific messaging.

## 4. Responsive Testing

The website is fully responsive, but test on these key breakpoints:
- Mobile: 480px and below
- Tablet: 768px
- Small Desktop: 1024px
- Large Desktop: 1200px and above

## 5. Performance Optimization

If the animations cause performance issues:
1. Reduce the number of particles (in JavaScript)
2. Simplify some CSS animations
3. Optimize image sizes using tools like TinyPNG
